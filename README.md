# Impute Wealth
This repo contains files to imputation of wealth using a capitalization method.  The scripts will be based around the IRS SOI Public Use File and imputing wealth to records on these data.  The methods for doing this are outlined in Saez and Zucman (2016) and Smith, Zidar, and Zwick (2019). All efforts to enhance these methods will be documented.
